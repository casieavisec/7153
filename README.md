In this analysis, I am predicting sales of different items in a superstore (Walmart) for 28 days by looking at sales data from 2011 to 2016.

I used docker to create a virtual PySpark environment on my computer. I have used PySpark exclusively to analyse the data and create machine learning models. 

I created the following models:<br>
• LinearRegressor<br>
• DecisionTreeRegressor<br>
• RandomForestRegressor<br>
• LightGBMRegressor<br>
• GBTRegressor<br>

I used databricks community version for creating two models which rather took long hours to run on my machine.

The goal of this notebook is not to create the best model but to understand, learn and apply distributed computing using apache spark wrapped in python library pyspark.
